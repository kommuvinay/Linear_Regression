1)It depicts values(observations) plotted with an independent variable(x_axis) and a dependent variable(y-axis).

2)Independent variables are variables that are manipulated or changed whose effects are measured and compared to the dependent variables.

3)The dependent variables refer to that type of variable that measures the effect of the independent variable(x) of the graph analysis.

4)When there is a single continuous dependent variable and a single independent variable, the analysis is called simple linear regression analysis.

5)The distance between the line and a data point is called error.

6)The point which is on the line then it is called as estimated value.

7)The point which is away to the line it is the real value.

8)actual value - estimated value = error
